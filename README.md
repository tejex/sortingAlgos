Sorting Algorithms and their performances written in Erlang

Purely recursive sorting algorithms written in the functional programming language, Erlang. 

This project will be investigating the effect of using parallel programming and parallel execution on a sorting algorithm.

Algorithms were given the task of sorting lists which contained 5,000 items to lists containing 1,000,000 items.
